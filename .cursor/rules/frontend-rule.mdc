### Rules for Frontend

1. **Visual clarity and contrast**
   - Use a clearly readable color palette; avoid low-contrast text/background combinations.
   - Never place white (or near-white) text on a white (or near-white) background.
   - Respect accessible contrast ratios (aim for at least WCAG AA for body text whenever practical).

2. **Pleasant, adaptive UX**
   - Layouts must adapt gracefully to different content lengths; boxes and containers should grow or shrink to fit their contents.
   - Avoid horizontal scroll on common screen sizes; favor responsive layouts and sensible breakpoints.
   - Provide clear visual feedback for user actions (hover, active, focus states on buttons/inputs).

3. **Sensitive information handling**
   - Any field that collects sensitive data (passwords, tokens, API keys, etc.) must use a password-style input (e.g. `type="password"` or equivalent).
   - Never log or display sensitive values in the UI once entered.

4. **Framework choice**
   - Prefer building new UI using Next.js as the primary framework, since it integrates best with Vercel.
   - Use idiomatic Next.js patterns for routing, data fetching, and deployment (e.g. app router where applicable).

5. **Vercel deployment and local development**
   - Design the frontend so it can be deployed on Vercel without special/manual tweaks (e.g. avoid server features Vercel does not support).
   - Ensure the same app can be run locally with simple commands (e.g. `npm install` / `npm run dev` or equivalent) and documented env requirements.

6. **Running instructions**
   - Whenever you create or significantly change a UI, provide clear, up-to-date instructions for how to run it (locally and, if relevant, on Vercel).
   - Update any existing README or docs section that explains how to start the frontend when you change the required commands or environment.
