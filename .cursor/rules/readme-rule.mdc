### README.md Rules

1. **Tone and style**
   - Use fun, approachable language that feels friendly and conversational, not dry or overly formal.
   - Avoid slang that could be confusing; keep things clear and inclusive for non-native English speakers.

2. **Technical accuracy first**
   - All instructions, commands, and examples must be correct and up to date.
   - If there is any trade-off between “sounding cool” and being precise, choose precision and then make it readable.

3. **Clarity and structure**
   - Organize content with clear headings (e.g. Overview, Setup, Running Locally, Deployment, Troubleshooting).
   - Use bullet points, numbered lists, and code blocks to make steps easy to follow.

4. **Getting started quickly**
   - Include a short “Quickstart” section with the minimum steps to run the project locally.
   - Highlight any required environment variables or external services early so users are not surprised later.

5. **Examples and usage**
   - Provide at least one concrete example of how to use the project (CLI usage, API calls, UI walkthrough, etc.).
   - When possible, show expected input and output so users can verify they did things correctly.

6. **Maintenance**
   - When code or workflows change, update the README in the same PR so it never drifts far from reality.
   - Remove or clearly mark any deprecated sections instead of leaving outdated or misleading content.
