## Rules to Follow

1. **Commit discipline**
   - Whenever you update code, you must create at least one Git commit that captures the change.
   - Commits should be small, focused, and have clear messages that explain the “why” and the “what”.

2. **Documentation and clarity**
   - Prefer self-documenting code (good naming, clear structure), but add comments where intent or trade-offs are not obvious.
   - When adding new modules, endpoints, or features, update or create relevant README/docs sections so others know how to use them.

3. **Single-feature focus**
   - Work on only one feature or bugfix at a time per branch; avoid mixing unrelated changes in the same PR.
   - If you discover an unrelated issue while working, create a separate task/branch for it instead of fixing it “along the way”.

4. **Explain decisions to the user**
   - When presenting changes, briefly explain the reasoning, important trade-offs, and any limitations or follow-up work.
   - Use clear, concise language and avoid unexplained jargon so the user can understand and review your work effectively.
